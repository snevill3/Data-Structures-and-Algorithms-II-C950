# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-II-C950
## Course Overview
<p>Data Structures and Algorithms II explores the analysis and implementation of high-performance data structures and supporting algorithms, 
including graphs, hashing, self-adjusting data structures, set representations, and dynamic programming. The course also introduces students to NP-complete problems. 
The course discusses how to use Python techniques to implement software solutions for problems of memory management and data compression. This course has two prerequisites: 
Data Structures and Algorithms I and Discrete Math II.</p>
